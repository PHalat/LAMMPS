# LAMMPS
A suite of codes to aid users create LAMMPS input files, to be used in conjuction with https://github.com/agiliopadua/fftool. 
These codes are best used when added to a $PATH variable.
All codes are written in the same style as the original fftool suite, meaning that calling any code with the command -h (--help) will give some instructions.
A manual is to be written soon (TM).
